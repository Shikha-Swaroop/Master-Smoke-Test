OpenType Fonts
The Unicode–based OpenType font format has been developed jointly by Microsoft and Adobe; 
it extends the TrueType font file format originally designed by Apple. OpenType fonts allow rich mapping 
between characters and glyphs, thus enabling support for ligatures, positional forms, alternates, and other substitutions. 
OpenType fonts can also include information that supports two–dimensional glyph positioning and glyph attachment, 
and can contain either TrueType or PostScript outlines. Layout features within OpenType fonts are organized by scripts 
and languages, allowing a single font to support multiple writing systems, even within the same script.

The Windows core fonts (Times New Roman, Courier New, Arial, MS Sans Serif, and Tahoma) contain Western and Central European, 
Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Turkish, Baltic, Cyrillic, and Vietnamese scripts but do not contain East Asian script characters. 
They link to fonts that do. The main reason behind the exclusion of these scripts is related to the massive performance 
overhead that East Asian glyphs would introduce in terms of font loading and mapping in GDI. In addition, these scripts 
would make the font size several times bigger. Instead of having instructions on how to create glyphs for several hundred 
characters, you would have instructions on how to create them for some 6,000 or 7,000 characters, approximately.
